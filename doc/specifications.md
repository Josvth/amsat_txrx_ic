## Frequency Bands

| Band | Centre Frequency | Bandwidth |
|:-----|:-----------------|:----------|
| S    | 2.4200 GHz       | 60 MHz    |
| C    | 5.7875 GHz       | 275 MHz   |
| X    | 10.2500 GHz      | 500 MHz   |

## Transmit

The C and X bands are nearly integer multiples of the S band. Therefore, two LOs are required to avoid an LO in the S band creating harmonics in the higher bands.

A first LO (LO1) will be used at 1.95 GHz to move the baseband to the IF. A second LO will be created to upconvert to the final RF frequency. The three LOs will be generated by a single synthesier with dividers used to create the lower frequencies.

| Name     | LO2             |
| :------- | :---------------|
| S        | 0.44 - 0.50 GHz |
| C        | 3.70 - 3.98 GHz |
| X        | 8.05 - 8.55 GHz |

To generate these frequencies a single frequency synthesiser will be used with frequency dividers used. The following table details the frequency range required by the phase locked loop.

| Name     | LO2             | Divider Value | VCO Frequency   |
|:---------|:----------------|:--------------|:----------------|
| S        | 0.44 - 0.50 GHz | 16            | 7.04 - 8.00 GHz |
| C        | 3.70 - 3.98 GHz | 2             | 7.40 - 7.96 GHz |
| X        | 8.05 - 8.55 GHz | 1             | 8.05 - 8.55 GHz |

The phase locked loop must therefore be capable of creating frequencies from 7.04 - 8.55 GHz. A center frequency of 7.8 GHz and tuning range of +/- 9.7%.

Finally, the effects of harmonics from the LOs falling into the
