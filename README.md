# Amatuer Radio Satellite Transceiver (SKY130) 

An Amateur Radio Transceiver IC (2.4 / 5 / 10 GHz) designed the Google/Skywater SKY130 130 nm CMOS process.

Will eventually contain a full transceiver design including:

- PLLs
- LNAs
- ADC
- DAC
- Digital Transceiver
- Power and Biasing Control
- (Maybe) Power Amplifiers

__Currently the repository is in the middle of clean-up and looks empty. View the development branch for all cells. Some of which will not be used in the main design__

Currently a work in progress...
