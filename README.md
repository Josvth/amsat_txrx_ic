# Amatuer Radio Satellite Transceiver (SKY130) 

An Amateur Radio Transceiver IC (2.4 GHz / 5 Ghz / 10 GHz) designed the Google/Skywater SKY130 130 nm CMOS process.

Will eventually contain a full transceiver design including:

- PLLs
- LNAs
- ADC
- DAC
- Digital Transceiver
- Power and Biasing Control
- (Maybe) Power Amplifiers

Currently a work in progress...
